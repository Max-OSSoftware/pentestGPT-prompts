# PentestGPT Prompt Engineering

## Introduction
This repository focuses on prompt engineering for the application PentestGPT developed by GreyDGL. The main objective is to experiment with different prompts and observe the resulting outputs. Due to restrictions such as rate limiting and token usage, there may be limitations on our abilities to fully explore the potential of PentestGPT.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to leverage the power of GPT-based language models for penetration testing and security-related tasks. By fine-tuning the prompts used with PentestGPT, we aim to enhance its performance and generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses for various security-related queries and scenarios.

## Repository Structure
- **/data**: Contains sample data, prompt templates, or any other relevant data files.
- **/experiments**: Includes different experiments performed with variations in prompts, configurations, or techniques.
- **/results**: Stores the outputs, observations, and analysis of the experimentations.
- **/scripts**: Contains helper scripts or automation tools used in the prompt engineering process.
- **/resources**: Includes external resources, references, or documentation related to prompt engineering, PentestGPT, or GPT-based models.

## Getting Started
To start experimenting with prompt engineering for PentestGPT, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/PentestGPT-prompts.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries required for running the experiments (if any).
3. Review the sample data and prompt templates available in the `/data` directory.
4. Explore the experiments conducted in the `/experiments` folder to understand different prompt variations and techniques.
5. Execute the experiments and observe the results.
6. Document your observations and insights in the `/results` directory.
7. Contribute by adding your own experiments, improving existing prompt templates, or sharing valuable insights.
